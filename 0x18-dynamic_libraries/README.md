## The following project covers:

- What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
- What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
- What are the differences between static and shared libraries
- Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig

## Requirements

# C

- All files compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
